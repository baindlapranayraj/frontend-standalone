# frontend-standalone 


- /price_markets
This page will have the following things.
We have the sticky navbar on top.
We need to have a "enter token address" input text at the center and with some padding up from the top.

We display data of the top performing coins on BASE with the following details : token name, token current price, token 24h,12h,6h gain from dexscreener api.
This data is to be presented in a grid layout with 4 columns.
This will be more like a table with fixed height and width and will have
scrollable feature.
A refresh button is given in the table top to refresh the data.

We will have a vertical navbar type thing on the left with the following page routes : my positions, pnp markets, trending tokens, create pnp market. Separate page for each route.
By default, we will show the "trending tokens" page.
